# File Reading and Writing Example

This project demonstrates how to read from and write to a file using Python. 

## Important Note

**To run this script successfully, you must modify the file path in the code to match your local environment.** 

Here's how to update the file path:

1. **Locate the Path Variable**: In the script, find the `inputFile` variable where the file path is defined.
   
   ```python
   inputFile = r'F:\d\Github\Software\Software-Development-Fundamentals\Object-Oriented-Programming\17- Read and Write to a File\17- Read and Write to a File (Ahmed Maher)\Ma7er.txt'

### 1. **Introduction to Data Structures**

#### What are Data Structures?

Data structures are organized ways to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently. They provide a means of organizing and accessing data in a computer's memory or even on a disk, making it easier to perform operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

#### Importance of Data Structures

The choice of data structure impacts the performance of algorithms and the overall efficiency of software. Good data structures optimize resource utilization, such as memory and processing power, enabling faster computation and more scalable solutions.

#### Algorithmic Complexity

Algorithmic complexity refers to the computational resources required by an algorithm as a function of the input size. The two most critical types of complexity are:

- **Time Complexity:** The amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size.
- **Space Complexity:** The amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution relative to the input size.

#### Time vs Space Complexity

Time and space complexity often trade-off; optimizing for one can increase the need for the other. For instance, an algorithm that runs quickly might use more memory, while one that uses less memory might run slower.

#### How to Calculate Complexity?

To calculate complexity, analyze how the algorithm's resource consumption grows with the input size. This is usually done by identifying the number of basic operations (like comparisons, additions, etc.) that the algorithm performs relative to the input size.

#### Asymptotic Notation

Asymptotic notation provides a way to describe the running time or space requirement of an algorithm as the input size grows. It simplifies complexity expressions by focusing on the dominant factors and ignoring lower-order terms and constant coefficients.

- **Big O Notation (O):** Describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It gives the worst-case scenario of an algorithm's growth rate.
  
  Example: `O(n)`, `O(log n)`

- **Big-θ Notation (Θ):** Represents the exact bound of an algorithm's running time. It provides a tight bound, showing both the upper and lower limits.
  
  Example: `Θ(n)`, `Θ(log n)`

- **Big-Ω Notation (Ω):** Describes the lower bound of an algorithm's running time. It gives the best-case scenario.
  
  Example: `Ω(n)`, `Ω(log n)`

#### Common Runtimes

- **Constant (O(1)):** The runtime does not change with the size of the input.
  
  Example: Accessing an element in an array by index.

- **Logarithmic (O(log n)):** The runtime increases logarithmically with the input size. Often seen in algorithms that divide the problem size in each step.
  
  Example: Binary search.

- **Linear (O(n)):** The runtime grows linearly with the input size.
  
  Example: Traversing an array.

- **Polynomial (O(n^k)):** The runtime grows at a polynomial rate, where `k` is a constant.
  
  Example: Nested loops that each run `n` times.

- **Exponential (O(2^n)):** The runtime doubles with each addition to the input size.
  
  Example: Recursive algorithms that solve problems by solving multiple smaller subproblems.

- **Factorial (O(n!)):** The runtime grows factorially with the input size.
  
  Example: Algorithms that generate all permutations of a set.

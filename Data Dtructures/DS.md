# Data Structures
### Definition: 

- A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

### Types of Data Structures
#### 1. Linear Data Structures 

- Array: A fixed-size collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations, accessed by index.
- Linked List: A sequence of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node. Variants include singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
- Stack: A collection with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) access, allowing operations like push and pop.
- Queue: A collection with First-In-First-Out (FIFO) access, allowing operations like enqueue and dequeue.
#### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
- Tree: A hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes. Types include binary trees and binary search trees.
- Graph: A set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, which can be directed or undirected.
#### 3. Hash Table
- Hash Table: Stores key-value pairs for efficient retrieval using a hash function. Collision handling methods include chaining and open addressing.

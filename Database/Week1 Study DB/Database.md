# Useful Resources


## General Description
A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are controlled by database management systems (DBMS). Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized.
